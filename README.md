# flashCalculations

for the compositional multiphase flow simulation approach, we need
to perform flash calculations to update the gas and liquid properties in each increment. To do so,
a flash calculation routine is needed to be coupled with the multiphase flow code. Suppose that the
following hydrocarbon mixture with zero water cut is introduced into an oil well bore. Perform
flash calculation at 1000 psia and 130Â°F using the original version of the Peng-Robinson equation
of state. Report the amount, compositions and molecular weight of both liquid and gas phases.
